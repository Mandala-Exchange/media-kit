Title: Listing on the Mandala Platform

Subtitle: Token and coins can now submit their projects for listing!

Body: We are excited to announce the Mandala Platform listing process for cryptocurreny projects! All too often, quality projects aren’t able to access high liquidity markets due to a lack transparency across the industry, especially when it comes to platform and exchange listing.  

Not only do we think the crypto space should be simple enough for everyone on the front end, but also for the developers and project founders that are working to build this great technology space. 

Thank you all for the continued support, we couldn’t do any of this without all of you!
